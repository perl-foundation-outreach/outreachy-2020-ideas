## Adding ideas

To add project ideas create a pull request for this repository.  Just copy the
[project idea template](project_template.md) into the [`perl`](perl) or [`raku`](raku) directory
(or create a new one if it does not fit exactly in any of them) and fill it
out. Use a separate file for each project idea.  Please also add your project
idea to the *Project ideas* list above, itemized. If you have an idea but no
mentor or the idea is not entirely fleshed out, add it to *incomplete project
ideas* and try to complete it. Ideas without a mentor will have to be removed
before this list is submitted to Google.

Project ideas need to meet certain criteria described [on this Outreachy
page](https://www.outreachy.org/mentor/mentor-faq/#define-a-project). If
you use the template you should be good to go. If you have an idea and
want to discuss it before adding anything, 
[discuss it in this issue or add a new one](https://github.com/perl-foundation-outreach/outreachy-2020-ideas/issues/1).
