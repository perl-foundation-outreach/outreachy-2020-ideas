Project Title (also add this to the overview list in [README.md](README.md))
==================================

Description
-----------

Raku documentation uses different tools to index, process and
generate HTML pages (and other formats). What can be said now about
the tooling is that it's working, but little else. Documentation needs
a lot of help, from copy-editing existing documentation (starting with
the most popular pages, like landing pages), to helping with front-end
programming, to HTML templates for the pages and general art. 


Expected outcomes
-----------------

Depending on the actual focus, we would be looking at

* Improvement in the front-end handling of the web site, from search
  to fluid layout, through the template used. It might include
  navigation and general accessibility and UX of the site, or
  guidelines for working on the site (further implemented using tests).
* Improvement in the automatic deployment of pages when changes are
  made.
* Creation or improvement of guides "From X to Raku", such
  as
  [this one, from Python to Raku](https://docs.raku.org/language/py-nutshell).
* Once the person is acquainted with the language, they can help
  improving examples for the documentation or writing new ones.

Onboarding or starter tasks
----------------

* Take a look at
  the
  [guide for contributing to the documentation](https://dev.to/jj/squashing-perl-6-documentation-bugs-one-at-a-time-4ojn) and
  then
  [check out the contribution guide](https://github.com/Raku/doc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
  
* Get acquainted with the Raku language, through one of the books or
  tutorials. Or using the [documentation](https://docs.raku.org) itself, at the same time that
  it's revised for typos, errors or simply things that can be
  improved.
  
* If focus is going to be on the web site, design a methodology for
  testing and create an issue with possible accessibility/UX/UI errors
  that have been found.
  
* Check out current or
  past [Perl/Raku weekly challenges](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/)
  and try to solve them, or make some improvements (including
  documentation) to solutions. It might include linking the
  documentation from comments in the code, for instance.
  


Required skills
---------------

* Experience in frontend design/UX, if that's the preferred option.
* Experiencie in scripting languages, if what is going to be done is
  improving the documentation, testing examples, writing new
  tutorials.
* Some experience with Raku, if the tast is going to be improving
  documentation tooling.


Rating
------

Easy to medium (depending on the tasks chosen).
